This is a starter code for Tensorflow with ResNet utilizing an easy dataset https://www.kaggle.com/c/statoil-iceberg-classifier-challenge.  2-fold CV performance is around 0.24-0.27


/* The FILES */

sh bash.sh ## run the training and prediction

train.py ## separate the training data in list_train into 5 parts, with nested training to record the best epoch and create 5 models into the dir model

predict.py ## predicting the testing data in list_test using one of the models

list_train ## training image list in the format of 'image\tlabel\n'

list_test ## testing image list in the format of 'image\tlabel\n'


/* How to play with this */

//* Changing input data *//

1. Change list_train and list_test with your image list. 
2. Change image input size : change 75 to the image size you need. 
3. Change number of channels: flags.DEFINE_integer('channels', 2, '') to 1; change line ~170 to line ~200 in train.py to fit the number of channels; 


//* Changing parameters or other models in *//

1. First set starts at line 20 in train.py : max_epoch=200 (number of times reading through all images here) , batch=16,  max_rotate=0, max_shift=20, max_scale=1.2, min_scale=0.9
2. Second set starts at line 61 to line 80 in train.py where you could change training parameters and models being called
